Introduction
============

Welcome to the unified guide for the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) across three
major operating systems: Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. DPDK is a set of libraries and
drivers that accelerate packet processing and the ability to create high-performance
networking applications. It is designed to run on any processor, knowing that the
majority of a CPU's time is spent handling packet receive/send functions.

DPDK is a powerful tool that can be used to create robust, high-speed network
applications. It provides a framework and common API for fast packet processing in data
plane applications. It is used extensively in high-performance telecommunication
applications, and it is increasingly being used in cloud and enterprise networking
systems.

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to DPDK, its features,
and how it can be utilized across different operating systems. Whether you are a network
engineer, a system administrator, or a developer, this guide will help you understand
how to leverage DPDK's capabilities to optimize network performance and throughput.

The guide is structured to provide specific instructions for each operating system,
recognizing the unique requirements and features of Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. 
By the end of this guide, you should have a solid understanding of how to implement and
use DPDK in your networking projects, regardless of the operating system you are using.

We hope this guide serves as a valuable resource as you explore the powerful
capabilities of DPDK.

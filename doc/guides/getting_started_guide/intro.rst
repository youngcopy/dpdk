Introduction
============

Welcome to the unified getting started guide for the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) covering Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. DPDK is a set of libraries and
drivers that accelerate packet processing and allow the user to create high-performance
networking applications.

The guide is structured to provide basic step-by-step instructions with OS-specific instructions for each operating system where necessary. 
By the end of this guide, you should have a solid understanding of how to implement and
use DPDK in your networking projects, regardless of the operating system you are using.

We hope this guide serves as a valuable resource as you explore the powerful
capabilities of DPDK.
